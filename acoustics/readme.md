Acoustics of mirrored waves
===========================

Hypotheses
----------

**Propagation mode**. There are four modes of acoustic wave propagation:
longitudinal (compression), transverse (shear), surface (Rayleigh), plate (Lamb)
[1]. Transverse, surface and plate propagation are either much weaker than the
longitudinal propagation or their occur in specific conditions. Therefore, we
consider here only longitudinal waves.

**Material**. All mediums are considered here to be isotropic. That is, the
elastic constant is equal in all directions of the medium.

Variables
---------

Compressional velocity (speed of longitudinal wave propagation, in m/s):

-   In copper :

    -   4660 [2]

        -   4760 (annealed) [6]

        -   4760 (annealed) [7]

        -   4660 [10]

        -   3560 [13]

    -   In air:

        -   331.45 (dry) [6]

        -   331.2 (dry at 0°C) [8]

        -   331 [13]

    -   In composite:

        -   4726 (Glass fiber-reinforced polyester composite) [9]

        -   3070 (graphite/epoxy) [10]

        -   2100 (L385:340 epoxy at 20°C) [11]

        -   2460 to 3170 (depending on thickness and material ratio) [14]

    -   In water:

        -   1480 (at 20°C) [10]

        -   1483 (at 20°C) [12]

        -   1484 [8]

        -   1493 [13]

        -   1496 (distilled) [6]

Acoustic impedence (in Ns/m³):

-   Copper:

    -   41.6e6 [3]

-   Air

    -   413 (at 20°C) [3]

-   Water

    -   1.48e6 [3]

Formula
-------

Share of the energy which is reflected at the boundary between two media of
acoustic impedences z1 and z2 [4]:

$$((z2-z1)/(z2+z1))^2;$$

Angle of the transmitted wave meeting the boundary between two media of
longitudinal wave velocities v1 and v2 at an angle alpha, derived from Snell’s
law [5]:

$$asin (sin(incident_angle)*v2/v1)$$

Critical angle of longitudinal wave transmission:

$$x = asin (v1/v2)$$
